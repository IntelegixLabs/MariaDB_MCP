## Idea Title
MariaDB MCP Server: AI-Native Interface for Relational + Vector Workloads

## Problem Statement
Organizations want to leverage AI agents to interact with operational and analytical data safely. Traditional database access patterns are not AI-friendly, lack semantic capabilities, and risk unsafe writes or long-running queries. Teams need a secure, observable, AI-native interface to query structured data and perform semantic search with guardrails.

## Approach
Expose MariaDB through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so AI assistants can call tools for schema discovery, read-only SQL, and vector search. Add reliability (timeouts, pooling), safety (read-only mode, write allow-list), abuse prevention (rate limiting), and observability (structured errors, correlation IDs). Optional embeddings support enables vector stores for semantic search at the database layer.

## Use Case
- Analysts: Ask natural questions via AI to retrieve tables, schemas, and summaries.
- Developers: Use MCP tools in IDE assistants to inspect DBs and run safe queries.
- LLM Apps: Perform RAG against vector stores in MariaDB with consistent security controls.
